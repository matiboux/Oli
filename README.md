## Get started!

*Warning: The BETA is barely documented.*

### Prerequisites

First, you need to make sure you have a working web server set up, with PHP installed. 

As the framework is currently in BETA, please be careful with your installation: Oli is developed using an Apache server with PHP 7.0 and MySQL installed, and no tests has been run using other configations.

### Install

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/OliFramework/Oli/releases/latest), extract the archive and place Oli in your web server file directory.  
The last thing you'll have to do is the config! Need help with that? [Here's a more detailed guide to get started](https://github.com/OliFramework/Oli/wiki/Get-started). (**WIP**)

Once the framework set up, you can create and place your pages in the **/content/theme/...** directory as *.php* files.  
You can place your CSS stylesheets and JS scripts in the **/content/theme/assets/...** directory for an easier access through Oli, using its built-in HTML tools.

### Some extras

**You might also want to look into other things that might help you:**  
Want to use a database with your website? Import the [default Oli SQL file](https://github.com/OliFramework/Oli/blob/master/oli.default.sql) in your MySQL database, and update your *config.json* file with the MySQL access infos.  
Need to use the account management feature? Learn about the [official Oli login page](https://github.com/OliFramework/Oli-Login-Page)!
