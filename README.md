# Oli Framework BETA 1.7.0

**Oli** is an *open source PHP framework* made to help web developers creating their website.

**Community is everything!**
Support me, suggest me anything!

You're a developer? You can create your own addon for Oli, [here's how](#).

### Start using it

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/OliFramework/Oli/releases/latest) and extract Oli on your web server.
Let's check **config.json** now! Need help to configure it? [Here's how to get started](https://github.com/OliFramework/Oli/wiki/Get-started).

Once configuration is done, you can start create your pages in "**content/theme/...**" directory. Put your stylesheets and scripts in "**content/theme/data/...**" directory for an easier access through Oli.
